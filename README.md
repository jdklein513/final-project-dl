# Predicting Major League Baseball Pitch Type with Deep Learning

## Synopsis

In 2019 Major League Baseball completed its 150th season with about 68.5 million fans attending regular season games. Although the game existed for almost a century and a half, only in the last seven years has video technology and cloud services enabled pitch by pitch tracking to further improve both in-game and out-of-game baseball analytics as well as the fan viewing experience. Today, tracking capabilities capture every pitch including pitch velocity, location, spin rate, batted ball launch angle and exit velocity, and the result of the pitch (i.e. strike, ball, out, single, home run). This paper aims to leverage this publicly available data and deep learning techniques to assess the feasibility of predicting the next pitch type a major league baseball pitcher will throw to a hitter in an at-bat. Our research shows that applying the most advanced algorithms predict the next pitch type with 47.6% accuracy.

## Repo Structure

+ **adhoc**: stores any ad hoc code used to perform the exploratory data analysis on available statcast data sources. This is generally code for one time tasks like exploration or data prep.

+ **code**: stores notebook code for business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, model fitting, and evaluation.

+ **output**: sore the html versions of the notebooks used for data preparation and model fitting.

## How to run code

Execute jupyter notebook files in code folder in order.
